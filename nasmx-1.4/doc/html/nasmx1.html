<h3><a name="section-1.1">1.1 What Is NASM-X?</a></h3>
<p>NASM-X is a set of macros for the Netwide Assembler, NASM, designed
for portability, modularity, ease of use, and speed of development.  Portability means that the complete macro-set can be used for both 32 and 64 bit assembly with no change in syntax.
Modularity implies NASM-X fully supports projects having multiple source files along with external linkage.
Ease of use and speed of development are featured benefits of using NASM-X as the macros correctly handle all supported calling conventions, ensure proper stack alignment, and ensure proper structure layout and memory alignment.<br>
<br>
NASM-X currently supports both 32 and 64-bit development on the following operating systems:<br>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>FreeBSD</li>
<li>NetBSD</li>
<li>OpenBSD</li>
<li>Windows</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="section-1.3">1.3 Contact Information</a></h3>
<p>The current version of NASM-X is maintained by a
team of developers, accessible through the
<code><nobr>nasmx-devel</nobr></code> mailing list (see below for the link).
<p>NASM-X forums are currently located at
<a href="http://www.nasm.us/"><code><nobr>http://www.nasm.us/</nobr></code></a>.
If it's not there, google for us!
<p>New releases, release candidates, and daily development snapshots of
NASM-X are available from 
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/"><code><nobr>http://www.sourceforge.net/</nobr></code></a>.

<h3><a name="section-1.4">1.4 Installation</a></h3>
<h4><a name="section-1.4.1">1.4.1 Installing NASM-X under Windows</a></h4>
<p>Once you've obtained the appropriate archive for NASM-X,
<code><nobr>nasmx-X.X.zip</nobr></code> (where
<code><nobr>X.X</nobr></code> denotes the version number of NASM-X contained
in the archive), unpack it into its own directory (for example
<code><nobr>c:\nasmx</nobr></code>).
<p>The archive will contain a set of executable files: the NASM executable
file <code><nobr>nasm.exe</nobr></code>, the NDISASM executable file
<code><nobr>ndisasm.exe</nobr></code>, and additional utilities.
<p>The files NASM-X needs to run are located in the <code><nobr>nasm-X.X/bin</nobr></code> directory.
You may either copy these programs to a directory on your PATH, or
alternatively, edit <code><nobr>autoexec.bat</nobr></code> to add the
<code><nobr>nasmx/bin</nobr></code> directory to your
<code><nobr>PATH</nobr></code> (to do that under Windows XP, go to Start
&gt; Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced &gt; Environment Variables;
these instructions may work under other versions of Windows as well.)
<p>You must also set the <code><nobr>NASMENV</nobr></code> environment variable
to point to the install include directory, eg: <code><nobr>NASMENV=-IC:\nasmx\nasmx-X.X\inc\</nobr></code>
<p>That's it - NASM-X is installed.<br>
<h4><a name="section-1.4.2">1.4.2 Installing NASM-X under Unix</a></h4>
<p>Once you've obtained the Unix source archive for NASM-X,
<code><nobr>nasmx-X.X.tar.gz</nobr></code> (where
<code><nobr>X.X</nobr></code> denotes the version number of NASM-X contained
in the archive), unpack it into a directory such as
<code><nobr>/usr/local/src</nobr></code>. The archive, when unpacked, will
create its own subdirectory <code><nobr>nasmx-X.X</nobr></code>.
<p>NASM-X is not an auto-configuring package: once you've unpacked it,
<code><nobr>cd</nobr></code> to the directory it's been unpacked into and
type <code><nobr>./setpaths.sh</nobr></code>. This shell script will set up
your environment so that you can use NASM-X.  So that you don't have to
source this file each time you open a new terminal you can simply add the
<code><nobr>NASMENV</nobr></code> environment variable to your login profile.
For example, when using the <code><nobr>bash</nobr></code> shell, add the line <code><nobr>export NASMENV=-I/usr/local/src/nasmx-X.X/inc/</nobr></code>
to your <code><nobr>.bashrc</nobr></code> file located in your home directory.
<p>The NASM-X package for Linux does not come with any binaries.  The demo programs require that the following programs already exist on your computer:
<code><nobr>nasm, gcc, make</nobr></code>.
