 Each of the subdirectories contain fully functional
 applications which have been designed around NASMX's
 capabilities. Each one demonstrates the usage of this
 collection for the design of 64-bit Windows applications.
 Below is a list of all current demonstration packages and
 their function.

  DEMO1  - Demonstrates basic usage.
  DEMO2  - Demonstrates the use of the Standard C Library
           (MSVCRT) in a console mode program
  DEMO3  - Demonstrates the use of Win64 Console functions
           to achieve input, output and exiting from a
           console mode program
  DEMO4  - Demonstrates use of floating point with type double
  DEMO5  - Demonstates basic windowing operations
  DEMO6  - Bitmap and Timer example

 You are permitted to use these demonstration applications and
 the NASMX.INC file as you see fit, so long as any source
 releases of your software gives us credit for our file.
 (basically, leave the NASMX.INC header alone)
