 Each of the subdirectories contain fully functional applications
 which have been designed around NASMX's capabilities. Each one
 demonstrates the usage of this collection for the design of
 32-bit Windows applications. Below is a list of all current
 demonstration packages and their function.

  DEMO1  - Demonstrates basic usage.
  DEMO2  - Demonstrates the design of a simple window.
  DEMO3  - Demonstrates the use of a owner-drawn control.
  DEMO4  - Demonstrates a simple dialog based application.
  DEMO5  - Demonstrates a dialog application with user interaction.
  DEMO6  - Demonstrates an alternative message handling method.
  DEMO7  - Demonstrates the use of the StdWin.inc macros
  DEMO8  - Demonstrates the use of HL features such as do/while,
           do/until, and switch/case macros
  DEMO9  - Demonstrates how to create dynamically linked libraries and
           add them statically using the dllproc macro
  DEMO10 - Demonstrates the use of inline argument calling with proc
           and the use of the if/elsif/else/endif macros.
  DEMO11 - Demonstrates the use of the Standard C Library (MSVCRT)
           in a console mode program
  DEMO12 - Demonstrates the use of Win32 Console functions to achieve
           input, output and exiting from a console mode program
  DEMO13 - Demonstrates the use of nested structures and unions
  DEMO14 - Demonstrates using floating point variables
  DEMO15 - OpenGL Torus example
  DEMO16 - GTK example
  DEMO17 - Bitmaps and Timer example

 You are permitted to use these demonstration applications and the
 NASMX.INC file as you see fit, so long as any source releases of
 your software gives us credit for our file.
 (basically, leave the NASMX.INC header alone)
